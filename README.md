# Software Developer

**SKILLS: C#, .NET, Python, SQL, MonoGame Framework, Agile, Excel / Sheets, Graphic Design, Communication, Problem-solving / Root Cause Analysis, Adaptability, Teamplayer**

### Summary

I have a non-traditional education, as I started learning code from online resources and books in highschool. Over the course of a few years, I developed multiple games and code libraries, making my education a hands-on experience. I've used and am familiar with C#, Python, JSON, HTML, CSS, MonoGame (formerly XNA).

I'm definitely an information guy. I absolutely love to study new ideas and develop new skills. I'm a creative, out of the box thinker. I'm a decent verbal communicator, but I really excel in written communication. I'm persistent, but also patient.

I'm looking to join a company to further my understanding of the software development process and sharpen my skills.

### Roles

- **Software Developer** at Emberium Studios, independent. *(2014 to 2019, current)*. Alongside coding, I created the graphic, user interface, and game design to further product development.
- **Technical Assistant, Revenue Analyst** at Hearthside Grove *(2019 to 2022)*. My responsibilities included technical assistance, bookkeeping, drone operation, and acting as a front desk agent.

### Projects

- **[Procedural Language Generator](plgl.md)**. This code library takes a sentence from your preferred written language and transforms it according to the constraints of a new, fictional language. I researched the building blocks of languages, developed a strategy for the code structure, and programmed its features and functionality within a two month timeframe. See *Figure 1*. *(December 2022)*
- **Revenue Management Dashboard**. A configurable rate dashboard which pulls data together, updating the data in the calendar view and weekly sparklines accordingly. I was responsible for aggregating the data, and assisted in analyzing trends to optimize the company's future rates. See *Figure 4*. *(September 2022)*
- **[Pilgrimage of Embers](https://github.com/Highverve/POE)**. A two-dimensional action role-playing game inspired by Dark Souls. This was my first project in C# / .NET, and increased my understanding of the software development cycle. See the code, devlogs and .exe on its GitHub page. *(April 2014)*
- **[Project Merchantry](https://github.com/Highverve/Project-Merchantry)**. A game about crafting items and bartering. I developed the code, created the artwork, and wrote the devlogs and social media posts before releasing the alpha six months later. See *Figures 2 and 3*, and the code and devlogs on its GitHub page. (*September 2018*)
- **Monument**. A game and software launcher to access free and Patreon-exclusive content. *(March 2018)*
- **MonoGame UI Library**. An internal library for streamlining UI creation. (February 2018)
- **[MonoGame Particle System](https://github.com/Highverve/ParticleEngine)**. An internal library for two-dimensional visual effects. See *Figure 5*.
- **[Space-capitalism!](https://d1fdloi71mui9q.cloudfront.net/fjwsB84yQhOzrClXFee8_project%20space-capitalism%20watermarked.pdf)**. A master game design document about our universe in the future. *(November 2020)*
